# What Are Variables?

## Introduction to Variables in Statistics

In statistics, a **variable** is a property or characteristic that can take on different values. Understanding variables is fundamental because statistics deals with various types of data.

> **Definition:**  
> A variable is a property that can take any value, but only one value at a time.

For example:
- **Age** is a variable; it can be 25 or 30, but not both at the same time.
- **Gender** is a variable; it can be "male" or "female".
- **Height** is a variable; it can be 175 cm or 182 cm.

A list of values (e.g., 20, 25) is not a variable, but rather a collection of values that a variable can take.

## Types of Variables

Variables are classified into two main types:

1. **Quantitative Variables**
2. **Qualitative (Categorical) Variables**

### Quantitative Variables

Quantitative variables represent numerical values and can be further divided into:

- **Discrete Quantitative Variables**
- **Continuous Quantitative Variables**

#### Discrete Quantitative Variables

Discrete variables take only whole number values (no fractions or decimals).

**Examples:**
- Number of children: 3 (not 3.5)
- Number of houses: 5 (not 5.5)
- Number of students in a class: 50

#### Continuous Quantitative Variables

Continuous variables can take any value within a range, including decimals and fractions.

**Examples:**
- Age: 25.5 years
- Height: 175.5 cm
- Weight: 72.7 kg

### Qualitative (Categorical) Variables

Qualitative variables represent categories and do not have numerical values.

**Examples:**
- Gender: male, female
- Colors: red, green, blue
- Places: city, village

## Summary

- **Discrete quantitative variables:** Whole number values (e.g., number of children, bank accounts).
- **Continuous quantitative variables:** Any value, including decimals (e.g., height, weight).
- **Qualitative (categorical) variables:** Categories without numerical values (e.g., gender, colors).

## Key Takeaways

- A variable is a property that can take any value, but only one value at a time.
- Variables are broadly classified into **quantitative** and **qualitative (categorical)** types.
- Quantitative variables are divided into **discrete** (whole numbers) and **continuous** (any value including decimals).
- Qualitative variables represent categories such as gender or colors and do not have numerical values.
